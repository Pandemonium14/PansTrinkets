# PansTrinkets
A Slay the Spire Mod.

Adds a new kind of reward and a new card color.

Trinkets currently have a 20% chance to drop after every combat, and always drop if there is a rare card in the card rewards.
They spawn linked to the card reward, so you have to choose which one you take.

Trinket card are supposed to be strong or to respond very well to specific needs. I expect this mod to make the game generally easier. I just don't want to make it trivial.

At the moment, there should be enough cards to play through one or two runs without it being too repetitive, but it won't last very long.
